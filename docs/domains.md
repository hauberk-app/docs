# Domains

Hauberk sends emails on your behalf using your verified domain(s).

To verify a domain, you must configure DNS records granting us permission to send email on your behalf. If you don't have access to configure DNS records, we provide an easy way to send domain setup instructions to a teammate.

## Creating a Domain

Go to [hauberk.app/domains/new](/domains/new)

**Region:** select the region closest to the majority of your users

**Domain:** We recommend choosing a subdomain that corresponds to the type of emails you will be sending. On the Pro plan you can create as many domains as you need.

For example: use `auth.yourdomain.com` for sending password reset emails, use `updates.yourdomain.com` for sending monthly account statements.

## Verify DNS records

Verifying DNS records requires adding the Hauberk-generated records to your DNS provider. Adding these DNS records to your provider authorizes Hauberk to send email using your provided domain name.
