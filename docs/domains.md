# Domains

Hauberk sends emails on your behalf using your verified domain(s).

To verify a domain, you must configure DNS records granting us permission to send email on your behalf. If you don't have access to configure DNS records, we provide an easy way to send domain setup instructions to a teammate.

Need help configuring DNS? Contact us at [team@hauberk.app](mailto:team@hauberk.app)
