# Domains

Hauberk sends emails on your behalf using your verified domain(s).

To verify a domain, you must configure DNS records granting us permission to send email on your behalf. If you don't have access to configure DNS records, we provide an easy way to send domain setup instructions to a teammate.

Need help configuring DNS? Contact us at [team@hauberk.app](mailto:team@hauberk.app)

## Creating a Domain

Go to [hauberk.app/domains/new](/domains/new)

Region: select the region closest to the majority of your users
Domain: we recommend choosing a subdomain that corresponds to the type of emails you will be sending. On the Pro plan you can create as many domains as you need.

For example: use `auth.yourdomain.com` for sending password reset emails, use `updates.yourdomain.com` for sending monthly account statements.
